## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the
[DriveQu Code of Conduct](https://github.com/febriadj/drivequblob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior
to <iamfebriadji@gmail.com>.

## Question

> If you want to ask a question, I assume that you have read the available [Documentation](https://github.com/febriadj/drivequ/blob/master/README.md).

Before you ask a question, it is best to search for existing [Issues](https://github.com/febriadj/drivequ/issues) that might help you. In case you have found a suitable issue and still need clarification, you can write your question in this issue. It is also advisable to search the internet for answers first.

If you then still feel the need to ask a question and need clarification, I recommend the following:

- Open an [Issue](https://github.com/febriadj/drivequ/issues/new).
- Provide as much context as you can about what you're running into.
- Provide project and platform versions (nodejs, npm, etc), depending on what seems relevant.

I will then take care of the issue as soon as possible.

### Reporting Bugs

#### How Do I Submit a Good Bug Report?

> You must never report security related issues, vulnerabilities or bugs including sensitive information to the issue tracker, or elsewhere in public. Instead sensitive bugs must be sent by email to <iamfebriadji@gmail.com>.
<!-- You may add a PGP key to allow the messages to be sent encrypted as well. -->

I use GitHub issues to track bugs and errors. If you run into an issue with the project:

- Open an [Issue](https://github.com/febriadj/drivequ/issues/new).
- Explain the behavior you would expect and the actual behavior.
- Please provide as much context as possible and describe the *reproduction steps* that someone else can follow to recreate the issue on their own. This usually includes your code. For good bug reports you should isolate the problem and create a reduced test case.
- Provide the information you collected in the previous section.

<!-- You might want to create an issue template for bugs and errors that can be used as a guide and that defines the structure of the information to be included. If you do so, reference it here in the description. -->
